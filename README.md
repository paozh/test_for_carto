Level Of Achievement: Gemini
Project Scope:

Simplified:
To create a single-page web application with the aim of processing and consolidating important information for prospective BTO-flat buyers, and thus simplifying their decision-making process.

Detailed description:
It has always been a hassle to search for relevant information online regarding Built-To-Order (BTO) flats. The information is usually scattered across different websites and users may miss out on some critical details. Hence, we aim to create a website that not only summarises past and future BTO launches, but also allows users to make comparisons between the flats they are interested in.
The criteria for comparison will include the primary considerations for our target audience: accessibility of amenities, convenience (proximity of public transportation), schools. By consolidating important information for our audience, we hope to be able to empower users to make informed decisions and simplify the difficult process of buying a new home in Singapore.
 
Prototyping: Include core features developed, problems encountered
Core features:
Front-end UI of single-page web application using Blueprintjs API
Implementation of an interactive map using Carto.js via Leaflet
‘Back-end’ is integrated into Carto.js where the data will be used for visualisations and Analysis for the interactive map 
Problems:
Obtaining of required data
Integration of the Reactjs & Carto.js in the web application as we revamped our project only quite recently due to the project consultation we had from the Google Engineers
Refinement:
Bugs Fixed:
1.	Fixed issue on interactivity on Leaflet Layer & Carto Client
2.	 
Edge Feature developed:
1.	Interactivity on Leaflet Map
a.	Tooltip to show details extracted from json file
b.	Popup
2.	Legends
3.	Controls Limitations for ease of User
4.	Reset function to reset Map View
5.    Algorithm to calculate nearest neighbour  
Problems Encountered:
Some bugs when integrating different libraries
Had huge difficulty getting the interactivity to work for different layers


User Testing:
